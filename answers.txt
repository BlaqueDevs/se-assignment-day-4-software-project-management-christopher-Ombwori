1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery ensures meeting business goals, maintaining client trust, and avoiding cost overruns. To meet deadlines, project managers should set clear milestones, manage scope, use Agile methods, and track progress.



2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control prevents budget overruns, ensuring profitability and resource efficiency. Strategies include accurate cost estimation, tracking expenses, risk management, and using budget-tracking tools.



3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is iterative, flexible, and allows frequent feedback, but may lack structure. Waterfall is linear, well-defined, but rigid. Agile suits dynamic projects, while Waterfall fits projects with clear requirements.

4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is iterative, flexible, and allows frequent feedback, but may lack structure. Waterfall is linear, well-defined, but rigid. Agile suits dynamic projects, while Waterfall fits projects with clear requirements.


5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality assurance methods: code reviews, automated testing, CI/CD, and user feedback. High standards prevent bugs, improve reliability, and enhance user satisfaction.

6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining scope prevents scope creep and misalignment. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks projects into smaller tasks for better planning and tracking.

7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Detailed schedules improve planning and resource allocation. Gantt charts visualize tasks, dependencies, and timelines for better project tracking.


8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Core issues addressed: inefficiency, manual errors, lack of automation, or poor user experience. Significance: Improves productivity, reduces costs, and enhances decision-making.


9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem ensures a focused solution, minimizes wasted effort, and aligns development with user needs.
